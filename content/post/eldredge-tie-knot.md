I have found two ways to tie the Eldredge knot. [Linwoods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXyWSAmwVZ4) version attempts to make it so that the tail end comes back down behind the big end of the tie instead of tucking in under the collar. However, I found that I couldn't get it to look nice pulling it down through the loop under big end, so I ended up tucking it udner the collar anyway.

The second method I tried is the [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FukqiewJuPw) method. I used the same tie as with the first method, and this method uses up more tie; I had less tail end to tuck under my collar, but it was harder to get the last loop under.
