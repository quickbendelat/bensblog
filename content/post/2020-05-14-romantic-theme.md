After wearing the first Rosebud, I then did the second Rosebud, followed by the Vidalia. It was at that point that I decided to continue with the romantic theme, and followed up with the three heart shaped knots seen in the middle row of the collage below. The Vampire is a bit of a stretch for this theme, but I followed it up with the Embrace, so to my mind, it fits.
