This collection of tie knots are themed around windy storms. I've had comments that the Tornado knot looks messy, but I quite like the look of it. I tried the Cyclone knot with a few different ties, but it didn't quite look right until I found that it works well with a striped tie if the stripes can converge in the centre, similar to how the Trinity knot looks better also with stripes converging.
