Project Date: September 2021

When using my personal laptop, I have been using it on top of a box while sitting on the floor. The sitting on the floor is not too bad, as I don't tend to use my laptop for much apart from updating this blog. However, I've been thinking for a while now that it would be nice to replace the box with a better mini desk (but I would still be sitting on the floor). I could then make a platform to be able to use a keyboard (and not just the laptop keyboard). 

I hunted around my garden shed to find suitable pallet wood, and my plan had to be designed based on what was available. I sketched out a few designs before settling on one, from which I then colour coded the sketch based on the three different pallet wood thicknesses I had.

The blue planks were the thinner planks that make up the pallet loading surface. I only had 3 of these planks and I needed 6 for this table, so I had to make the width of the table half the length of these planks in order to have enough. The orange and purple were the structural braces from pallets, but the purple ones are slightly thicker (and denser) than the orange.

I didn't have enough long screws to be able to hold the computer desk structure together, and since I made this during COVID lockdown level 4, I could not go to the hardware store to buy more. What I did have were nails, so I drilled pilot holes, then put nails through along with PVA wood glue on the joining surfaces to construct the two side frame components. I did have enough of the correct length screws to attach the thinner planks to the frame components, which when screwed in, resulted in a solid structure. I had one mishap where I split the wood when drilling in a screw despite having pilot holes. The learning after that was to use a counter sink bit to allow the head of the screw to safely sink into the wood.

Now I can use this set up to write future blog posts!
